# Kitabi — Status (Source of Truth)

> **Living document.** Update this file in the same commit whenever architecture,
> integrations, deployment, or feature status changes — it's the one place to look
> for "what is this, what's it built with, what's live, what's done." Don't let it
> drift: if a fact here would surprise someone reading the code, fix the fact here.
>
> Other docs stay narrower: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) is dev conventions and non-negotiable
> rules, [feature-map.md](feature-map.md) is the full product spec, [docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md)
> is the phase-by-phase checklist, [docs/screen-design.md](docs/screen-design.md) is design
> tokens. This document summarizes and cross-links all of them plus the live/deployed state
> those docs don't cover.

## Snapshot

Solo-built personal library app, pre-launch. **Phase 1 (auth & profile) is complete and
live in production** — real Google + Apple sign-in, a real Supabase project, a real
Railway deployment at a real custom domain. Phases 2–8 (catalog, personal library,
lending, sync engine, insights, recommendations, launch plumbing) are not started.
The landing page is live and public; the mobile app is not yet store-submitted (still
pre-Phase-2, no personal-library feature exists in the app yet beyond the auth shell).

---

## What this is

Kitabi ("Beyond the Bookshelf") is a mobile-first personal library app positioned
between reading trackers (Goodreads, StoryGraph) and collection apps (Libib): ownership
tracking + free first-class lending + an Edition-level "real bookshelf" feel, with a
regional/translation angle (`.in`, Malayalam roots) and quiet, transparent LLM
recommendations. Long game: personal app now, community platform later, without a
rewrite — see [feature-map.md](feature-map.md) for the full four-layer product spec.

---

## Architecture

Same architecture as the sibling project `rupee-diary` (proven there; see that
project's own `STATUS.md`), adapted for a catalog + personal-library domain instead
of shared budgets:

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│    Flutter App         │  ← user works here, ALWAYS against local DB (Layer 2 data)
│  ┌─────────────────┐  │
│  │  Drift (SQLite)  │  │  ← source of truth on device for personal library data
│  └────────┬────────┘  │
│     Sync Engine         │  ← queue, retries, conflict rules (not yet built)
└──────────┬────────────┘
           │ HTTPS (JWT)
┌──────────▼────────────┐      ┌───────────────────┐
│   FastAPI (Railway)    │◄────►│ Supabase Postgres  │
│  - shared catalog API   │ pool │ - canonical data    │
│  - personal-data sync   │ 6543 │ - Auth (Google/Apple)│
│  - recommendations      │      │ - RLS deny-by-default│
└────────────────────────┘      └───────────────────┘
```

Two data tiers, never conflated (feature-map.md's core principle):
- **Layer 1 — shared catalog** (books, authors, publishers, genres, series): server-authoritative,
  fetched/cached, not user-synced.
- **Layer 2 — personal** (library entries, statuses, notes, tags, lending, reviews,
  progress): offline-first, Drift is the source of truth, synced via the sync engine
  (queue + push/pull, not yet implemented — Phase 3).

The `Profile` row (this session's Phase 1 work) is neither — it's the user's own
identity row, keyed directly by the Supabase auth user id, updated via direct online
`GET/PATCH/DELETE /me` calls, no sync queue involved.

## Repository layout

Monorepo root — see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the full convention. Three independent
parts, each with their own README and CI workflow:

| Directory | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `landing-page/` | Static "launching soon" site | **Live** at kitabi.in |
| `api/` | FastAPI backend | **Live** at api.kitabi.in — auth/profile only so far |
| `app/` | Flutter mobile app | Scaffolded + auth flow working; no catalog/library UI yet |
| `docs/` | Mockups, design tokens, task checklist | — |

---

## Integrations & external services

| Service | Purpose | Account / project ref | Configured in |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Supabase** | Postgres + Auth (Google, Apple) | Project ref `lwyifccwirfmgdvemgkz`, region Southeast Asia (Singapore), org "Shamsheer AT's Projects" (workspace also holds rupee-diary) | `api/.env` (`DATABASE_URL` = Supavisor transaction pooler, port 6543; `SUPABASE_URL`) |
| **Google Cloud OAuth** | Google sign-in | One **Web application** OAuth client (not Android/iOS native), redirect URI = Supabase's `/auth/v1/callback` | Configured in Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Google |
| **Apple Developer** | Apple sign-in | App ID `in.kitabi.kitabi` (Sign in with Apple capability), Services ID `in.kitabi.kitabi.web`, a Sign in with Apple key (Key ID + Team ID `62686X3746`) | Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Apple. Secret JWT regenerated via `api/scripts/gen_apple_secret.py` (expires ~6 months — no automation for this yet, see Open decisions) |
| **Railway** | API hosting | Project `kitabi-api`, service `kitabi-api`, connected to `shamshi-at/kitabi.in` (branch `main`, Root Directory `api`) for git-based auto-deploy | `api/railway.json` (Dockerfile builder, `/healthz` healthcheck); env vars set directly in Railway dashboard (not in repo) |
| **Cloudflare** | DNS (kitabi.in), landing page hosting | `api` CNAME → Railway target (proxied), SSL/TLS Full (strict); Pages project `kitabi-in` for the landing page | DNS: Cloudflare dashboard (manual). Pages deploy: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, secrets `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`/`CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| **GitHub Actions** | CI (lint/test/build checks only — not deployment) | `shamshi-at/kitabi.in` | `.github/workflows/api-ci.yml`, `app-ci.yml`, `deploy.yml` (landing only) |

Deliberately **not** using: Firebase (not yet needed — no push notifications built),
any paid metadata API (open decision), Redis/queues (cost rule — CLAUDE.md rule 8).

## Deployment — live URLs

| What | URL | Hosted on | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Landing page | https://kitabi.in | Cloudflare Pages, git-deploy from `landing-page/` on push to `main` | Live, public |
| API | https://api.kitabi.in | Railway service `kitabi-api`, proxied CNAME via Cloudflare (Full strict) | Live; auth/profile endpoints only |
| API (origin, fallback) | https://kitabi-api-production.up.railway.app | Direct Railway domain | Keep working in case the custom domain ever breaks |
| Mobile app | — | Not store-submitted | Tested on iOS Simulator against the real Supabase project during Phase 1 |

Redeploy the API by pushing to `main` (Railway auto-deploys); no manual `railway up`
needed anymore. Redeploy the landing page the same way (push to `main` touching
`landing-page/**`).

---

## Environments & secrets

Secrets live in exactly two places, never in the repo:
- **`api/.env`** (gitignored) — local dev database URL, Supabase URL. Copy from `api/.env.example`.
- **Railway dashboard env vars** (production) — `DATABASE_URL` (Supavisor pooler), `SUPABASE_URL`,
  `ENV=production`, `SCHEDULER_ENABLED=true`.
- **GitHub Actions repo secrets** — `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` (landing page deploy only; API deploy doesn't go through Actions).
- **Apple's `.p8` private key** — kept locally outside the repo (used only to run `api/scripts/gen_apple_secret.py` when the OAuth secret needs regenerating); never committed.

---

## CI/CD

Mirrors rupee-diary's pattern exactly (see that project's own CI for comparison):

- **`api-ci.yml`** (paths: `api/**`) — ruff, black, pytest against a real `postgres:17-alpine`
  service container, pip-audit (advisory, `continue-on-error`), `docker build`.
- **`app-ci.yml`** (paths: `app/**`) — `flutter pub get`, `build_runner` (codegen — currently
  a no-op since no `@riverpod`/Drift schema exists yet, ready for Phase 3), `flutter analyze`, `flutter test`.
- **`deploy.yml`** (paths: `landing-page/**`) — the only workflow that actually deploys anything;
  ships to Cloudflare Pages.
- **API deployment is NOT via GitHub Actions** — Railway's own git integration watches
  `main` and redeploys on push (Root Directory `api`, set in Railway's dashboard, not
  expressible in `railway.json`).
- No backup workflow yet (rupee-diary's `backup.yml` — nightly encrypted `pg_dump` → R2 —
  is the reference; tracked in [docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md) Phase 8, not built since
  there's no real user data yet).

## Features — status

Full spec in [feature-map.md](feature-map.md); phase-by-phase checklist in
[docs/tasks.md](docs/tasks.md). Current state by phase:

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — Foundations | Monorepo, scaffolds, landing page, logo, mockups | Mostly done — CI workflow ✅, theme ✅; local dev runbook still open |
| 1 — Auth & profile | Google + Apple sign-in, profile bootstrap, visibility switchboard | **✅ Done, verified live in production** |
| 2 — Shared catalog | Books/authors/publishers/series, ISBN scan, Work vs Edition | Not started — **metadata source decision (OpenLibrary vs Google Books vs paid) is the next highest-leverage call** |
| 3 — Personal library + sync engine | Drift schema, sync queue, push/pull, status/notes/tags/ratings/reviews | Not started |
| 4 — Lending | Lend/borrow records, linked vs self-logged, due reminders | Not started (fully designed in mockups S8/S8b/S8c/S9) |
| 5 — Import | Goodreads/CSV import | Not started |
| 6 — Insights & search | Dashboard, stats, filters, author/publisher browse | Not started (designed in mockups S3/S4/S4b/S4c/S4d/S10) |
| 7 — Recommendations & share | LLM recs, per-book + personal share cards | Not started (designed in mockups S6c/S11/S13) |
| 8 — Launch plumbing | Version gate, backups, app icons, store listings, privacy policy | Not started (Railway deploy + custom domain items already done ✅) |

All 19 v1 screen mockups exist in [docs/kitabi_screens.html](docs/kitabi_screens.html),
audited against feature-map.md so every `[V1]` feature has a designed home before it's built.

## Recent milestones

- **4 Jul 2026** — Phase 1 complete: Google + Apple sign-in built, tested end-to-end on
  a real iOS simulator against a real Supabase project (real profile row confirmed in
  the database); API deployed to Railway with git-based auto-deploy; custom domain
  `api.kitabi.in` live with a valid certificate; CI workflows added.
- **4 Jul 2026** — Author/publisher browse pages, borrowed-books shelf (both directions
  of lending), and generic per-book share cards designed into the mockups + feature map.
- **3 Jul 2026** — Landing page redesigned in the Reading Room theme; logo finalized as
  "The Gold Line" after five concept rounds; full SEO metadata + multilingual quote carousel.
- **2 Jul 2026** — Monorepo restructure (landing-page/api/app), API and Flutter scaffolds,
  12 initial screen mockups, design tokens.

## Open decisions / known gaps

- **Metadata source** (OpenLibrary vs Google Books vs paid) — highest-leverage open item,
  blocks Phase 2.
- **Apple OAuth secret expiry** — the JWT Supabase uses for Apple sign-in expires every
  ~6 months (`api/scripts/gen_apple_secret.py` regenerates it); no reminder/automation
  exists yet — worth a calendar reminder or a scheduled check.
- **No backup job yet** — fine while there's no real user data; must exist before real
  users sign up (rupee-diary's `backup.yml` is the reference).
- **ISBN scanning package** — likely `mobile_scanner` (rupee-diary precedent), not yet added.
- **Local dev / Supabase project creation runbook** — not yet written (Phase 0 task).
